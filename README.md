# video-resize
A little tool for video resizing.

"Resize Only" : Literally, resize only, do not keep aspectratio.

"Resize to Width" & "Resize to Height" : Keep aspectratio. The difference between the two is which ratio to follow, width or height. The redundant will be left over and the short will be filled in black.

If it's not clear about which one to use, just preview before run.
