# video-resize
A little tool for video resizing.

"Resize Only" : Literally, resize only, do not keep aspectratio.
"Resize to Width" & "Resize to Height" : Keep aspectratio. The difference between the two is which ratio to obey, width or height. The redundant will be left over and the short will be filled with black.
If it's not clear about which one to use, preview before run.
